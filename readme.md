**Radio Stream to Spotify**

**ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§**

Given a online radio stream URL, this program periodically checks for any
song title being returned by the stream metadata (the "now playing"), looks
it up on Spotify, and then adds it to a playlist.

This code will only work with streams that actually report the current song
playing in the metadata, and it needs to be in a readable format. I have
done much of the testing with Absolute Radio streams (UK), which do report the
current song playing most of the time.

**Example Playlists**

* Playlist 1
* Playlist 2
* Playlist 3
